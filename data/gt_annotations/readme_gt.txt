These ground truth data were created by three students from winter term 2020 to 2022. I would like to thank Eugen Havasi, Baris Kalayci and Sebastian Georg RÃ¶der for providing them to the SIM12 students.

The columns in the CSV files indicate at which frames Kermit, Waldorf & Statler, Pigs and/or the Danish chef are visually present (no prefix) or can be heared ("Audio_*").
